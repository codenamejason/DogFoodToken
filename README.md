> Demonstration showing how SVG NFTs can be composed on top of each other.


# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

## Prerequisites

This branch is an extension of [loogie-svg-nft](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/loogies-svg-nft) branch (watch its [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0bwE5UelEo) to understand more about it), [optimistic-loogies](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/optimistic-loogies) branch and [composable-svg-nft](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/composable-svg-nft) branch.

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

### Installation

### Manual setup

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth fancy-loogies branch:

```
git clone -b fancy-loogies https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git fancy-loogies
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd fancy-loogies
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd fancy-loogies
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd fancy-loogies
yarn deploy
```

🌍 You need an RPC key for production deployments/Apps, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js`

🔏 Edit your smart contracts `packages/hardhat/contracts`.

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## Introduction

This branch shows how to set up an SVG NFT contract so that other NFTs can use it in their SVG code. This leads to an easy composition of SVG NFTs.

Take a look at `Loogies.sol` at `packages/hardhat/contracts`. It describes an SVG NFT that is defined by two parameters: `color` and `chubbiness` randomly generated at mint. It exposes a function:
```
function renderTokenById(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory)
```

It returns the relevant SVG that be embedded in other SVG code for rendering.

Then, you can mint a FancyLoogie from a Loogie and then send another NFTs (Bow, Mustache, ContactLenses and Eyelashes for now) to that Loogie, to be rendered as one SVG.

Take a look at `FancyLoogie.sol` at `packages/hardhat/contracts`:

* The `mintItem` function receive the loogieId to upgrade, call a transfer from the Loogies contract transfering the Loogie to the FancyLoogie contract. Then the `onERC721Received` function get called when the Loogie is received (see `_safeTransfer` function at `ERC721.sol` from `OpenZeppelin`).
* Its `renderTokenById` function calls the method `renderTokenById` from the other contracts  to include the SVG in its own SVG code.
* The FancyLoogie contract is ready to add new NFTs contract addresses to be able to add new accessories to the Loogies. Take a look to `addNft` function.
